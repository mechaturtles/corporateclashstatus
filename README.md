# Corporate Clash Server Tracker
Check it out: [mechaturtles.com/corporateclashstatus](https://mechaturtles.com/corporateclashstatus/)

This is a webpage designed to keep track of the [Toontown: Corporate Clash](https://corporateclash.net/) server statuses by making use of the [TTCC API](https://github.com/CorporateClash/api-docs).

My goal is to avoid spending money while making as much use of the API. To accomplish this, I am hosting this site on Github pages.
